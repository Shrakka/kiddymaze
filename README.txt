1) If you don't have npm: install npm

> npm install -g live-server   /!\ Install it globally, this is not a npm project ;)
> cd kiddymaze
> live-server   (you can use a different server if you wish like http-server but this one has hot reload)


2) Please git checkout -b "your_branch" and do Pull Request on master :)

3) If you want to add other JS file, include it in the index.html

4) game.js is a mess and have all responsability while it should not, so we'll probably have some refactor to do :)
